## CNN_hand2txt
Convolutional Neural Network reading hand written digit

# Model
The model contains 2 Convolution layers using Keras

# Sample
I used the real hand written digit from Statistic Math class
Hand written digits from the professor is hardly readable
Thus I made the CNN model to see how better machine can read

# Result
With the highest accuracy of 87.47%, CNN model perfoms less than 30% accuracy on Professor's hand written
